# In i3wm tiling window manager, I have this strange little issue where long
# left click on mouse invokes what ever I've bound to [code]$mod+d[\code].
#
# Now, i have bound rofi to [code]$mod+d[\code] and the rofi menu appears when
# I have not pressed the corresponding key binding. This does not happen all
# the time but when it does it gets really annoying and obstructs my work flow,
# especially when I using gimp or inkscape or trying to select texts.
#
# I've also tried to not bound anything to mod+d but then my browser tabs get
# closed instead.
#
# I think that if I bind  $mod+d to something like a ''no operation'' or NOP
# would do the trick.

# Right now I have it bound to a shell script that has nothing in it.

# bindsym exec bash aScriptThatDoesNothing.sh.

# But I was wondering if there was a fullproof solution to this or maybe just a
# better way to bind it to a no operation.
