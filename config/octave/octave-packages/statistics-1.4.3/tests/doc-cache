 -- [PVAL, F, DF_B, DF_W] = anova (Y, G)
     Perform a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

     The goal is to test whether the population means of data taken from
     K different groups are all equal.

     Data may be given in a single vector Y with groups specified by a
     corresponding vector of group labels G (e.g., numbers from 1 to K).
     This is the general form which does not impose any restriction on
     the number of data in each group or the group labels.

     If Y is a matrix and G is omitted, each column of Y is treated as a
     group.  This form is only appropriate for balanced ANOVA in which
     the numbers of samples from each group are all equal.

     Under the null of constant means, the statistic F follows an F
     distribution with DF_B and DF_W degrees of freedom.

     The p-value (1 minus the CDF of this distribution at F) is returned
     in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the standard one-way ANOVA table is
     printed.

 -- cor_test (X, Y, ALT, METHOD)
     Test whether two samples X and Y come from uncorrelated
     populations.

     The optional argument string ALT describes the alternative
     hypothesis, and can be "!=" or "<>" (nonzero), ">" (greater than
     0), or "<" (less than 0).  The default is the two-sided case.

     The optional argument string METHOD specifies which correlation
     coefficient to use for testing.  If METHOD is "pearson" (default),
     the (usual) Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient is
     used.  In this case, the data should come from a bivariate normal
     distribution.  Otherwise, the other two methods offer nonparametric
     alternatives.  If METHOD is "kendall", then Kendall's rank
     correlation tau is used.  If METHOD is "spearman", then Spearman's
     rank correlation rho is used.  Only the first character is
     necessary.

     The output is a structure with the following elements:

     PVAL
          The p-value of the test.

     STAT
          The value of the test statistic.

     DIST

 -- [PVAL, KS] = kolmogorov_smirnov_test (X, DIST, PARAMS, ALT)
     Perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test of the null hypothesis that the
     sample X comes from the (continuous) distribution DIST.

     if F and G are the CDFs corresponding to the sample and dist,
     respectively, then the null is that F == G.

     The optional argument PARAMS contains a list of parameters of DIST.
     For example, to test whether a sample X comes from a uniform
     distribution on [2,4], use

          kolmogorov_smirnov_test (x, "unif", 2, 4)

     DIST can be any string for which a function DISTCDF that calculates
     the CDF of distribution DIST exists.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative F != G.  In this case, the test
     statistic KS follows a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.
     If ALT is ">", the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative F > G is considered.
     In this case, the test statistic KS has a one-sided
     Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution.  The default is the two-sided
     case.

 -- [PVAL, K, DF] = kruskal_wallis_test (X1, ...)
     Perform a Kruskal-Wallis one-factor analysis of variance.

     Suppose a variable is observed for K > 1 different groups, and let
     X1, ..., XK be the corresponding data vectors.

     Under the null hypothesis that the ranks in the pooled sample are
     not affected by the group memberships, the test statistic K is
     approximately chi-square with DF = K - 1 degrees of freedom.

     If the data contains ties (some value appears more than once) K is
     divided by

     1 - SUM_TIES / (N^3 - N)

     where SUM_TIES is the sum of T^2 - T over each group of ties where
     T is the number of ties in the group and N is the total number of
     values in the input data.  For more info on this adjustment see

     One-Criterion Variance Analysis', Journal of the American
     Statistical Association, Vol.  47, No.  260 (Dec 1952).

     DF_NUM and DF_DEN degrees of freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative 'var (X) != var (Y)'.  If ALT is
     ">", the one-sided alternative 'var (X) > var (Y)' is used.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative 'var (X) > var (Y)' is
     used.  The default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- [PVAL, T, DF] = welch_test (X, Y, ALT)
     For two samples X and Y from normal distributions with unknown
     means and unknown and not necessarily equal variances, perform a
     Welch test of the null hypothesis of equal means.

     Under the null, the test statistic T approximately follows a
     Student distribution with DF degrees of freedom.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative 'mean (X) != M'.  If ALT is ">",
     the one-sided alternative mean(x) > M is considered.  Similarly for
     "<", the one-sided alternative mean(x) < M is considered.  The
     default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is
     displayed.

 -- [PVAL, Z] = wilcoxon_test (X, Y, ALT)
     For two matched-pair sample vectors X and Y, perform a Wilcoxon
     signed-rank test of the null hypothesis PROB (X > Y) == 1/2.

     Under the null, the test statistic Z approximately follows a
     standard normal distribution when N > 25.

     *Caution:* This function assumes a normal distribution for Z and
     thus is invalid for N ≤ 25.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) != 1/2.  If alt is
     ">", the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) > 1/2 is considered.
     Similarly for "<", the one-sided alternative PROB (X > Y) < 1/2 is
     considered.  The default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     If no output argument is given, the p-value of the test is

 -- [PVAL, Z] = z_test (X, M, V, ALT)
     Perform a Z-test of the null hypothesis 'mean (X) == M' for a
     sample X from a normal distribution with unknown mean and known
     variance V.

     Under the null, the test statistic Z follows a standard normal
     distribution.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
     against the two-sided alternative 'mean (X) != M'.  If ALT is ">",
     the one-sided alternative 'mean (X) > M' is considered.  Similarly
     for "<", the one-sided alternative 'mean (X) < M' is considered.
     The default is the two-sided case.

     The p-value of the test is returned in PVAL.

     For two samples X and Y from normal distributions with unknown
     means and known variances V_X and V_Y, perform a Z-test of the
     hypothesis of equal means.

     Under the null, the test statistic Z follows a standard normal
     distribution.

     With the optional argument string ALT, the alternative of interest
     can be selected.  If ALT is "!=" or "<>", the null is tested
